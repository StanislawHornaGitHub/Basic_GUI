### Powershell GUI
This is universal Graphical Interface to run Powershell script that requires 3 inputs form the user:
        
    Portal
    Login
    Password
Whole project was designed to be easily adjustable for any script, without a need to bother anything related to the designing or modifying the GUI itself. 

It also have own .exe file which is used to run the script, but you do not have to recreate new .exe when you are making changes to the tasks which are meant to be done.
